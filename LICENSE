                      (c) 2025 Tinkerbox Technology Private Limited
Additional Use Grant: You may make personal, commercial, and production use of the
                      Licensed Work, provided Your use does not include offering the
                      Licensed Work, or any derivative work thereof, as part of a
                      competing low-code, no-code, or SDK-based platform or service.

                      For the purposes of this license:

                      A "competing platform" is any service, SDK, or developer tool
                      that allows users to visually or programmatically build mobile
                      applications or user interfaces and whose primary purpose
                      significantly overlaps with Digia's paid platform offerings.

                      A "Product" means any application, service, or tool that embeds,
                      integrates, or builds upon the Licensed Work.

                      "Embedded" means including the source code or executable code
                      from the Licensed Work in a competing platform or Product, or
                      requiring the Licensed Work to function as part of a competitive
                      offering.

                      Hosting, using, or embedding the Licensed Work in commercial or
                      internal-use software that does not compete with Digia's core
                      offerings is permitted.
